    <h3>STAFF HARM REDUCTION</h3>
    <p>
      The Playbook goes into detail on the basics of progressive (SSC) BDSM play with an emphasis on consent and protocols around safely halting play.   Supporting this playbook all PLAYGROUND staff are on site to assist with our patrons and make sure supply and demand for the dungeon equipment is shared ethically and safely.
