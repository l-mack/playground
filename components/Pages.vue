    <h3>PLAY SPACE</h3>
    <p>
        As the name implies, a cornerstone of PLAYGROUND is to facilitate fun and safe BDSM play.  Our space has an open play space for members to explore.  Have a look at our comprehensive event <NuxtLink to="/playbook">PLAYBOOK</NuxtLink> for rules and how we facilitate safe play.
